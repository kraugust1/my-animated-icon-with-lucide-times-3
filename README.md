# Animated Icon Set

## Why? 
* Understand the parts of SVG elements that can be animated
* CSS Animations are lightweight and easy to implement and improve user experience
* Learn CSS tranforms, transitions, and keyframes
* Add existing animation libraries to your project and save time
* Use SVG icons in one's future projects

## How?
* Use GSAP aka GreenSock Animation library to apply CSS animations 
(which has NO FUCKING ORGINIZED 'LIBRARY' TO SPEAK OF; want to see if there is a wiggle effect? FUCK YOU, pay for a subscription and we still won't give you a comprehensive library of everything we fucked with and give you a snippet of what it actually does ((fuck your 'cheet sheet' it explains nothing));; here is just random fucking code to replace random fucking code you were already dealing with, OH JOY!)
* Use JavaScript to reduce quirks of CSS animations (which has no ability to for what I want to do)
* Use GSAP dev tools (which are terrible)
